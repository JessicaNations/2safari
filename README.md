# Angular Material Implemented
* Console errors unresolved
* side nav executed, but not the way it should be lol
    * It is appears under the existing content or else it's transparent
    * It doesn't close until you click the menu button again
    
* I'm scared to mess with the css
* The calendar list needs to be a chiplist, except I don't care lol
